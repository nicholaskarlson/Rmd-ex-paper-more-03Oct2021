This repository relates to R Markdown, which some people use to create academic journal articles, research papers, or even books. The Rmd files are the R Markdown files. These files are just plain text that you can open with a text editor such as Microsoft Notepad. A PDF file can be generated from an Rmd file. To generate a PDF with RStudio and R Markdown a LaTeX installation is required. Please note that I have hard-coded some directory paths into this repo's Rmd file that is only relevant to my computer, so if you want to run the Rmd file yourself, you will need to change these path strings. Example:  open the Rmd file "Rmd-ex-paper-more-03Oct2021.Rmd" with a text editor such as Notepad and search for the text: 

"C:\\Users\\root\\Documents\\Rprojects\\Rmd-ex-paper-more-03Oct2021\\data\\"

This is the sort of path string that needs to be changed for the Rmd files to run on your computer. There are not many of these path references in this repo's Rmd file (and if you miss any, RStudio will point them out when you try to knit the Rmd file to HTML, Word, or a PDF).
